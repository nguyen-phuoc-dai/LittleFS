            Logical page size of LittleFS partition, in bytes. Must be multiple
            of flash page size (which is usually 256 bytes).
            Larger page sizes reduce overhead when storing large files, and
            improve filesystem performance when reading large files.
            Smaller page sizes reduce overhead when storing small (< page size)
            files.
